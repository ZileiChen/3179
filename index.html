    <h1>Ore Mining in Australia</h1>

      country's exports.

          Mining is the biggest industry in Australia. The top 3 exports as well as production in terms of monetary
          value is iron, coal and gold. <br /><br />However, gold is one of the least mined materials in Australia. This
          is due to the price of gold, being valued a lot higher compared to iron and coal, thus less gold is required
          to be mined for more profit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Western Australia mines the most ores and minerals out of all other states, this is due to the high number of
          mines they have compared to other states. Majority of Western Autralia's mining profits also came from the
          last 40 years, where a massive mining boom occured in Australia
          <br />
          <br />
          As you can see, majority of our profits still come from iron and coal, making up almost 70 percent of the
          mining industry's export profits in the year 2019.
