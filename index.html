          Mining is the biggest industry in Australia. The top 3 exports as well as production in terms of value is
          iron, coal and gold. However, gold is one of the least mined materials in Australia. This is due to the price
          of gold, being valued a lot higher compared to iron and coal, thus less gold is required to be mined for more
          profit.
